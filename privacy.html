    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 10 Sep 2025</p>

    <p>McHub (“we,” “our,” or “us”) provides community, remittance comparison, service booking, and communication features for Myanmar people in Thailand and abroad. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application and related services.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you sign up with your phone number (OTP), we collect your phone number and a unique user ID generated by Firebase.</li>
        <li><strong>Profile Data:</strong> You may provide additional details such as name, profile picture, or bio.</li>
        <li><strong>Booking Data:</strong> When you request visa or community services, we collect booking details (e.g., service type, contact information, and notes).</li>
        <li><strong>Remittance Data:</strong> When you use the remittance comparison feature, we may collect your country/currency selections to display relevant provider rates. We do not process or store your payment information.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> We collect approximate or precise location to show nearby places, services, and relevant remittance options.</li>
        <li><strong>Chat Messages:</strong> Messages exchanged within the app are stored securely and may be anonymized if accounts are deleted.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect device identifiers, crash logs, and app usage analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>Localization Preferences:</strong> Your language choice (English or Myanmar) is stored for app settings only.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use your information to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide login, profile, booking, and remittance comparison functionality.</li>
        <li>Display nearby services, places, and community content.</li>
        <li>Facilitate messaging between users.</li>
        <li>Improve app stability, safety, and performance.</li>
        <li>Send notifications relevant to your bookings, remittance rates, or community updates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>McHub integrates with trusted third parties, including Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Crashlytics, Analytics) and the Facebook SDK (included but disabled; no data sent unless login feature is enabled later).</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage & Security</h2>
    <p>Data is encrypted in transit and stored securely. Local data (Hive cache) is stored only on your device, cleared upon logout or deletion. No data is sold or rented to third parties.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <p>You may delete your account at any time through the app or via our web portal. Deletion permanently removes your personal data; chat messages and feedback may remain visible to others but will be anonymized. Aggregated, non-identifiable data may be retained for analytics.</p>

    <h2>6. User Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to access, update, or delete your information. You can withdraw consent by deleting your account. Contact us for questions regarding data handling.</p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our services are not directed to children under 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child, we will delete it immediately.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted at <a href="https://mymchub.com/privacy">https://mymchub.com/privacy</a>.</p>
